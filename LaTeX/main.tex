\chapter*{Abstract}
This report describes a particular class of \glspl{vae} : the \glspl{dvae}. \glspl{dvae} are a specific class of models, adapted to the study of data sequences.
In \glspl{dvae}, the latent variables are structured themselves as a correlated set (usually a sequence also), aiming at encoding the temporal dimension of the data. 
We will review the general formulation of \glspl{dvae} and the detailed implementation of three models : extended Kalman filter, \gls{vrnn}, and \gls{gpvae}.

We then provide an overview of the information theory framework for data sequences -specifically some results on entropy rates- as an attempt to empirically  quantify the degree of "randomness" of data sequences.
In doing so, we can try and evaluate the expressiveness of \glspl{dvae}, and their relative performance with respect to other well-known models (such as \glspl{lstm}).

However, it is the theory of stochastic calculus that will provide us with great insights regarding the expressiveness of \glspl{dvae}.
First, we will see that the solution of a \gls{sde} is a Markov Process, that can quite naturally be expressed as a \gls{dvae}.
Furthermore, if the \gls{sde} is actually linear, we will see that its solution is actually a Gaussian Process, and fits naturally into the \gls{gpvae} model. 
All the associated results of the kernels theory (notably results on the spectral theory) then apply.

Armed with those results, we carry out some experiments, to demonstrate... SURPRISE.

\part{Dynamical Variational Autoencoders}

This part presents the general framework of \glspl{dvae}. We start with a reminder of the key notion of \textbf{D-separation}, which is central in \glspl{gpm}.

Then, we describe three models in details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep Kalman Filter} : this model arises as the first evolution of the well-known Kalman Filter, with richer, \glspl{mlp} networks for the encoder and decoder.
    \item \textbf{Variational Recurrent Neural Network} : at the other end of the spectrum, \glspl{vrnn} provide the most expressive discrete-time formulation of the encoder and decoder.
We describe here a different implementation from the one described in \cite{girin_dynamical_2022}.
    \item \textbf{Gaussian Process Variational Auto Encoder} : in this model, the prior over the latent variables is no longer discrete, but is a \gls{gp}.
This allows for sampling data at irregular intervals. Another benefit is the use of richer kernel families to encode prior knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\part{Notions on stochastic differential equations and their relationships to \glspl{dvae}}

This part intends to present a self-contained material on stochastic calculus. 
The goal is to highlight the relationships between \glspl{sde} and \glspl{dvae}.
The part is designed so a complete beginner on the matter -with sufficient mathematical background though !- may grasp enough notions so the relationships appear natural.
However, stochastic calculus is a full mathematical field in itself, and a detailed presentation is out of the scope of this report.

The interested reader will likely enjoy \cite{mouvement-brownien-calcul-ito}, \cite{sarkka_applied_2019}, and refer to \cite{cours-jf-legall}, for a fuller review of the subject.
