This is due to the base-rate fallacy phenomenon, that in order to achieve substantial values of the Bayesian detection rate

              , we have to achieve a (perhaps in some cases unattainably) low false alarm rate.

Complex threat patterns and malicious actors are able to cause severe damages to cyber-systems. In this work, we propose novel Deep Learning formulations for detecting threats and alerts on network logs that were acquired by pfSense, an open-source software that acts as firewall on FreeBSD operating system. pfSense integrates several powerful security services such as firewall, URL filtering, and virtual private networking among others. The main goal of this study is to analyse the logs that were acquired by a local installation of pfSense software, in order to provide a powerful and efficient solution that controls traffic flow based on patterns that are automatically learnt via the proposed, challenging DL architectures. For this purpose, we exploit the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) in order to construct robust multi-class classifiers, able to assign each new network log instance that reaches our system into its corresponding category. The performance of our scheme is evaluated by conducting several quantitative experiments, and by comparing to state-of-the-art formulations.},

	abstract = {Monitoring traffic in computer networks is one of the core approaches for defending critical infrastructure against cyber attacks. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proposed in the past as a tool to identify anomalies in computer networks. Although detecting these anomalies provides an indication of an attack, just detecting an anomaly is not enough information for a user to understand the anomaly. The black-box nature of off-the-shelf ML models prevents extracting important information that is fundamental to isolate the source of the fault/attack and take corrective measures. In this paper, we introduce the Network Transformer (NeT), a DNN model for anomaly detection that incorporates the graph structure of the communication network in order to improve interpretability. The presented approach has the following advantages: 1) enhanced interpretability by incorporating the graph structure of computer networks; 2) provides a hierarchical set of features that enables analysis at different levels of granularity; 3) self-supervised training that does not require labeled data. The presented approach was tested by evaluating the successful detection of anomalies in an Industrial Control System (ICS). The presented approach successfully identified anomalies, the devices affected, and the specific connections causing the anomalies, providing a data-driven hierarchical approach to analyze the behavior of a cyber network.},

            Genetic network programming (GNP)‐based class association rule mining has been demonstrated to be efficient for misuse and anomaly detection. However, misuse detection is weak in detecting brand new attacks, while anomaly detection has a defect of high positive false rate. In this paper, a unified detection method is proposed to integrate misuse detection and anomaly detection to overcome their disadvantages. In addition, GNP‐based class association rule mining method extracts an overwhelming number of rules which contain much redundant and irrelevant information. Therefore, in this paper, an efficient class association rule‐pruning method is proposed based on matching degree and genetic algorithm (GA). In the first stage, a matching degree‐based method is applied to preprune the rules in order to improve the efficiency of the GA. In the second stage, the GA is implemented to pick up the effective rules among the rules remaining in the first stage. Simulations on KDDCup99 show the high performance of the proposed method. © 2012 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

            Cyber security is an important concern for all individuals, organisations and governments globally. Cyber attacks have become more sophisticated, frequent and dangerous than ever, and traditional anomaly detection methods have been proved to be less effective when dealing with these new classes of cyber threats. In order to address this, both classical and Bayesian models offer a valid and innovative alternative to the traditional signature‐based methods, motivating the increasing interest in statistical research that it has been observed in recent years. In this review, we provide a description of some typical cyber security challenges, typical types of data and statistical methods, paying special attention to Bayesian approaches for these problems.},

	abstract = {In the recent years, cybersecurity has gained high relevance, converting the detection of attacks or intrusions into a key task. In fact, a small breach in a system, application, or network, can cause huge damage for the companies. However, when this attack detection encounters the Artificial Intelligence paradigm, it can be addressed using high-quality classifiers which often need high resource demands in terms of computation or memory usage. This situation has a high impact when the attack classifiers need to be used with limited resourced devices or without overloading the performance of the devices, as it happens for example in IoT devices, or in industrial systems. For overcoming this issue, NBcoded, a novel light attack classification tool is proposed in this work. NBcoded works in a pipeline combining the removal of noisy data properties of the encoders with the low resources and timing consuming obtained by the Naive Bayes classifier. This work compares three different NBcoded implementations based on three different Naive Bayes likelihood distribution assumptions (Gaussian, Complement and Bernoulli). Then, the best NBcoded is compared with state of the art classifiers like Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest. Our implementation shows to be the best model reducing the impact of training time and disk usage, even if it is outperformed by the other two in terms of Accuracy and F1-score ({\textasciitilde} 2\%).},

The basic task of an IDS is to act as the first line of defense, in detecting attacks on the internet. As intrusion tactics from intruders become more sophisticated and difficult to detect, researchers have started to apply novel Machine Learning (ML) techniques to effectively detect intruders and hence preserve internet users' information and overall trust in the entire internet network security. Over the last decade, there has been an explosion of research on intrusion detection techniques based on ML and Deep Learning (DL) architectures on various cyber security-based datasets such as the DARPA, KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, CAIDA, CTU-13, UNSW-NB15. In this research, we review contemporary literature and provide a comprehensive survey of different types of intrusion detection technique that applies Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms as a classifier. We focus only on studies that have been evaluated on the two most widely used datasets in cybersecurity namely: the KDDCUP'99 and the NSL-KDD datasets. We provide a summary of each method, identifying the role of the SVMs classifier, and all other algorithms involved in the studies. Furthermore, we present a critical review of each method, in tabular form, highlighting the performance measures, strengths, and limitations of each of the methods surveyed.},

The notational framework is rich enough to encompass a variety of existing procedures, including some recently discussed methods involving stochastic search or hierarchical clustering, but more importantly allows the formulation of clustering procedures that are optimal with respect to a specified loss function. Our focus is on loss functions based on pairwise coincidences, that is, whether pairs of items are clustered into the same subset or not. Optimization of the posterior expected loss function can be formulated as a binary integer programming problem, which can be readily solved by standard software when clustering a modest number of items, but quickly becomes impractical as problem scale increases. To combat this, a new heuristic item-swapping algorithm is introduced. This performs well in our numerical experiments, on both simulated and real data examples. The article includes a comparison of the statistical performance of the (approximate) optimal clustering with earlier methods that are model-based but ad hoc in their detailed definition.},

(I) The support of the prior distribution should be large--with respect to some suitable topology on the space of probability distributions on the sample space. (II) Posterior distributions given a sample of observations from the true probability distribution should be manageable analytically.},

	abstract = {A random process called the Dirichlet process whose sample functions are almost surely probability measures has been proposed by Ferguson as an approach to analyzing nonparametric problems from a Bayesian viewpoint. An important result obtained by Ferguson in this approach is that if observations are made on a random variable whose distribution is a random sample function of a Dirichlet process, then the conditional distribution of the random measure can be easily calculated, and is again a Dirichlet process. This paper extends Ferguson's result to cases where the random measure is a mixing distribution for a parameter which determines the distribution from which observations are made. The conditional distribution of the random measure, given the observations, is no longer that of a simple Dirichlet process, but can be described as being a mixture of Dirichlet processes. This paper gives a formal definition for these mixtures and develops several theorems about their properties, the most important of which is a closure property for such mixtures. Formulas for computing the conditional distribution are derived and applications to problems in bio-assay, discrimination, regression, and mixing distributions are given.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse solutions to regression and classification tasks utilising models linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels). We detail the Bayesian framework and associated learning algorithm for the RVM, and give some illustrative examples of its application along with some comparative benchmarks. We offer some explanation for the exceptional degree of sparsity obtained, and discuss and demonstrate some of the advantageous features, and potential extensions, of Bayesian relevance learning.},
